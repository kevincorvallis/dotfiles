# Global Context

- **Obsidian vault**: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Notes/`
- **Personal website**: `~/Downloads/Projects/website/` — klee.page, hosted on AWS Amplify

# Git Commits

- Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages
- Keep commit messages short and concise — one line, under 50 characters when possible
- No multi-line descriptions unless explicitly asked
- On commit or push, update the relevant Obsidian note to reflect what was done

# Claude/Agent Config Files

- Keep `.claude/` and `.agents/` files minimal and concise
- Don't overcomplicate — short, clear directives only
